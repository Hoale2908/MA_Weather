What I learned:

- Grouping data together to have fewer categories using dictionary. Helpful for visualization. Example: 
    - grouping events into flood-related, wind-related, snow-related.
    - grouping county and zone of the same name.
    - grouping months to seasons.
- Work with dates and times using pandas and dateime.
- Work with string.
- Ask meaningful analytic questions.
- Investigate data for reclassification.
- Visualziation: only show one or two key ideas.
- Find data sources and compiling data for my research.
