What I learned:
- Find data sources and compiling data for my research.
- Investigate data for reclassification.
- Grouping data together to have fewer categories. Helpful for visualization. Example: 
    - grouping events into flood-related, wind-related, snow-related, etc.
    - grouping county and zone of the same name.
    - grouping months to seasons.
- Work with dates and times using pandas and dateime.
- Work with string: split, replace, strip.
- Ask questions to delve into details.
- Visualziation: only show one or two key ideas. Do not make it too complicated.
