It was embedded within the larger area of derecho/straight-line wind damages that occurred.  It was on the ground for less than a minute, traveled about one-half mile, had a path width of only 50 yards, and estimated maximum wind speeds of 75 to 80 mph.||The tornado began near Orchard Street, just to the west of Ridge Street, and traveled east-southeastward to the Oak Grove Playground/Millis Historical Commission on Exchange Street.  On Orchard Street, the tops of a few large trees were sheared off.  According to one resident, she had two trees down from west to east in her back yard, but she observed the wind change directions and the aforementioned tree tops were blown northward, landing in her yard.  At the Oak Grove Playground, a large tree was downed from west to east but a metal lamp post was blown northwestward toward that tree.  Other trees were observed down from as far west as Tupello Road to as far south as Causeway Street and Island Road.  Damage reportedly went as far east as Environmental Drive, Larch Road, and Dwight Street, but that had since been cleaned up.  Those damage areas likely were associated with the broader straight-line winds of the large-scale derecho that impacted much of Massachusetts, northeast Connecticut, and northern Rhode Island on October 7th.","A squall line formed in New York State then raced eastward in the late afternoon and early evening, gathering strength as it raced across Massachusetts, northeast Connecticut, and northern Rhode Island.

Eight inches of mud and stone had to be cleared from the rails, resulting in two freight trains being delayed. The cause was likely due to the heavy rains on Friday, December 25th.","An area of low pressure tracking from the Great Lakes to Hudson Bay advected in an unseasonably warm air mass into the region from Thursday, December 24 to Friday, December 25, 2020. Rain gradually overspread the region from west to east during the day on December 24 with the steadiest, heaviest rainfall during the overnight hours and early morning hours of December 25. Rain showers continued through the day on December 25 and changed to snow showers during the evening and overnight hours of December 25-26 as colder air returned.||The region still dealt with nearly the entire snowpack from the blockbuster winter storm from December 16-17. While the snow compacted over time, very little water was lost from the snow. Observations concluded that between 1.50 to 2.50 inches of water was in the snowpack prior to this event and most if not all of this snow melted.||Rainfall totals across western Massachusetts ranged from 1.00 to 2.50 inches. These amounts do not include the additional 1.50 to 2.50 inches of water that melted from the snowpack. The combination of warm air, rainfall and melting snowpack likely led to a debris flow outside the west portal of the Hoosac Tunnel near North Adams. Eight inches of mud and stone had to be cleared from the rails, resulting in two freight trains being delayed.||In addition to the rainfall, gusty winds accompanied the event with wind gusts reaching 40 to 55 mph. Wind gusts of 48 and 47 mph were recorded at the Harriman-and-West and Pittsfield Municipal airports, respectively. In addition, a tree was downed in the Town of Richmond.||Key Impacts: transportation delays, tree damage.",479

Wind gusts were estimated as high as 110 mph, which is on the high end of the Enhanced Fujita EF-1 ranking.  Harwich spent $1.2 million on cleanup of roads.

The following |information summarizes all of the reports. ||The tornado touched down near a red barn near the intersection of |Quinebaug Road (Route 131) and Riverside Drive (Route 12). It was |reported to be about 50 yards wide and tracked northeastward in a |discontinuous path, impacting areas just south of Ryler Court at |Riverside Drive, Wilsonville Road, Wagher Road, and Denis Drive at |Labby Road.  It then crossed the Massachusetts/Connecticut state |line and ended as a waterspout in Lake Chaubunagungamaug. Although |discontinuous, the total path length was 4.7 miles. The approximate |path width was 50 yards. Damage photos led to estimates of maximum |wind speeds of 80 to 85 mph, which puts this on the upper end of |the EF0 category of the Enhanced Fujita Scale. The time, based on |radar and eyewitness accounts, was from 1015 AM to 1024 AM EDT. ||More specifically, when the tornado touched down near Backwater |Brook, it snapped several trees in half in a convergent fashion. |It caused minor backyard damage at a nearby property before felling |numerous trees and power lines near the intersection of Riverside |Drive and Ryler Court. Tree damage was also reported at Wilsonville |Road and several trees were snapped in the backyard of a house near |Wagher Road and Forest Hill Drive. A tree was partially snapped near |Denis Drive at Labby Road before causing minor damage near Woods |Grove. Finally, multiple residents witnessed a waterspout over Lake |Chaubunagungamaug before dissipating near Killdeer Island.","The remnants of Tropical Storm Fred moved across Southern New England producing heavy rain, gusty winds, and two tornadoes - one that moved from northeast Connecticut into Worcester County and another in central Worcester County.",215
